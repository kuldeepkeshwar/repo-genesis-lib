## Questions

1. What's the performance difference (if at all) using something like [git-clone](https://github.com/jaz303/git-clone) vs [git-js](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js) ?

2. In the case of [run-git-command](https://www.npmjs.com/package/run-git-command) does it make sense to use a more generic git command runner ?

3. What happens in the event that someone clones a repo in two locations ? Do branches persist across two locations?

4. Will there be pathing issues with relative repos in Windows environment ?
